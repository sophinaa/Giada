          <p>
            Happy Birthday to one of my favourite people !!
            <br /><br />
            Every single day I'm genuinely glad I met you. I truly wish you all the happiness in
            the world. I hope you find exactly what you're looking for, and get everything you ever
            dreamed of. The best part of my week is when I call you. You are amazing to be with
            and talk to , I appreciate your presence increasingly everyday.
            <br /><br />
            The stars reminds me of you, so bright so beautiful and so far away. You have the
            sweetest soul I ever seen, thank you for being exactly who you are. Thank you for
            trying to always make me happy, I'll always support what are you doing, like you always
            support me &lt;3
            <br /><br />
            I love how we're always on the same wavelength and just connect, talking with you never
            drains me and makes the time fly (haha get it?) by really fast.
            <br /><br />
            I can't wait to see you again in London
            <br />
            Lots of love
            <br />
