            <strong>Giada: A Collection of Unforgettable Moments</strong><br />
            <strong>A super brief run down on The Berry</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            We only have space in this issue to touch on a handful of Giada’s top moments, and
            trust me, there are many. Although I’ve only known her for a relatively short time, it
            has been a genuine privilege watching her flourish over the past two or three years.
            Strangely enough, I must admit that many of my favourite Giada stories happened when I
            wasn’t even there to witness them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Take, for example, the now-infamous restaurant blackout. Yes, Giada somehow managed to
            turn off all the electricity in an entire restaurant. I can only imagine the split
            second of realisation when she understood what she had done. Has anyone ever truly been
            prepared for a moment like that? The image alone is unforgettable.
          </p>
          <p>But let’s rewind.</p>
          <p>
            <strong>🎓 The University Days</strong><br />
            Our story begins at the University of Dundee, where we met on my very first day. One
            small interaction led to another, and just like that, a friendship was formed. From the
            beginning, Giada was there when I needed someone most and that is the true mark of a
            friend. I suppose I owe it to her, at the very least, to finally watch The Lord of the
            Rings.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>🇮🇹 Giada & “Gigi”: A Legendary Duo</strong><br />
            No recounting of Giada’s best moments would be complete without mentioning her dynamic
            with Gilberto, better known as Gigi. To this day, I am not entirely convinced they ever
            had a normal conversation. Gigi has a firm preference for speaking exclusively in
            Italian, which made their exchanges all the more intriguing. From what little I
            overheard, clarity was not always his strong suit, whether with words or otherwise.
            There was even an incident where he “accidentally” insulted Giada in a way that would
            require an entirely separate article to unpack.
          </p>
          <p>
            And yet, in his mind, he and Giada were close friends, despite the fact that he
            couldn’t quite bring himself to say goodbye the last time they saw each other.
            Supposedly, they once had a deep, meaningful conversation. Giada, however, has no
            recollection of it. So one must ask: if she doesn’t remember it, did it really happen?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>🇮🇹 An Italian Interlude</strong><br />
            Although we didn’t spend a long time together in Italy, the time we did share remains
            incredibly meaningful to me. Giada is one of the most generous and wholesome people I
            know, a reflection of her wonderfully warm family. When I needed somewhere to stay at
            the last minute, she didn’t hesitate. That alone says everything.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’ll never forget sitting in the town square late at night, talking for hours. Or
            climbing a clock tower, convinced we’d discover a spectacular hidden rooftop, only to be
            slightly disappointed. The next morning, after waking up a little too late, we drove to
            Bologna, navigating confusing toll roads and closed shops. Still, Giada effortlessly
            showed me around, and we found the most amaaazing croissants that made the entire detour
            worthwhile.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her family welcomed us for lunch, where a spontaneous Harry Potter trivia moment
            unfolded, paired, unfortunately, with one of the worst desserts ever served. But we move
            on. I even had the chance to meet one of Giada’s close friends, Sara, as we wandered
            around a nearby town (whose name I am ashamed to admit I’ve forgotten).
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>🌟 Why Giada Stands Out</strong><br />
            These are just a few snapshots, fragments of stories that capture why Giada is so
            special. There are countless more moments that deserve their own paragraphs, their own
            pages, perhaps even their own issue.
          </p>
          <p>But for now, we’ll leave it here.<br />Until next time, dear reader.</p>

          <p class="newsletter-editor-note">
            The editor cannot wait to what will be put in the next issue. Please note that Giada is
            now currently enjoying the majority of her days playing soccer and giving back to the
            less academically capable.
